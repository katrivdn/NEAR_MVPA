# NEAR MVPA
Analysis of NEAR dataset using MVPA.
Code selects the relevant beta files (i.e. betas for main effect of small and big operations (n<4 and n>4) for non-tie problems). We then apply a searchlight analaysis, using a linear kernel. Cross-testing was applied using a leave-one-run-out procedure.
